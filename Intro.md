Course Syllabus for "ARTH210: American Art"
-------------------------------------------

This course surveys art of America from the colonial era through the
post-war 20<sup>th</sup> century.  We will consider broad stylistic
tendencies in various regions and periods and examine specific artists
and works of art in historical and social contexts, with emphasis on the
congruent evolution of contemporary American multi-cultural identity. 
We will move chronologically, more or less, with many overlaps and
cross-chronological, thematic diversions that will help shape this
overview and offer different perspectives on the notion of an “American
art,” per se. Overarching issues that have interested major scholars of
American art and its purview include the landscape (wilderness, Manifest
Destiny, rural settlement, and urban development); the family and gender
roles; the founding rhetoric of freedom and antebellum slavery; and
notions of artistic modernism through the 20<sup>th</sup> century.  A
background in the basic concepts and terms of art history and art
practice, and/or American studies in other disciplines, will be helpful
in fully engaging the course material. Note: The links in the drop-down
instructional boxes below will direct you to short essays with images,
unless otherwise noted.  Please click on all images encountered, as they
will often enlarge or show details; also note the size of the artworks
in descriptions, crucial to their form and their functions.  Viewing
original works in person is important for any study of art.  Please
identify a museum, gallery, or venue where you may closely view a work
of American art created before 1980.  A self-evaluation essay based on
your choice is assigned at the end of UNIT 3.  Other assignments are
based on the reading. At the end of this syllabus, you will find a
worksheet for general reference in studying art and a list of web
resources frequently noted below, as well as several additional sites
you can use to look up terms (including those bold-faced below), images,
artists, and styles.  To comply with all copyright laws, do not save any
downloads accessed for your personal viewing through websites assigned
below.
