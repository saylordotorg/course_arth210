**Unit 2: The 18th Century** <span id="2"></span> 
*During the 18<sup>th</sup> century, threats to Native American
societies began in earnest as fights over land between Europeans
escalated. “Modern” history painters commemorated the action, including
that of the American War of Independence, in a mix of Neoclassical and
Romantic styles, following the trends at British (and to a lesser extent
other European) royal academies.  This century also saw the design of
the capital city of Washington, D.C. and the emergence of a visual
discourse (including paintings, prints, and illustrations) around the
slave trade and plantation slavery system*.

**2.1 The Revolutionary Era** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Note: Major artists from this period include Benjamin West of
Pennsylvania and John Singleton Copley of Boston, both of whom settled
in England before the war, as well as Connecticut artist John Trumbull
(who spent much time there).  Early emblems of the new nation with
various personifications and Classical symbolism were designed; these
remain prevalent today.*

**2.2 The First President and the National Capitol** <span
id="2.2"></span> 
*Note: The representations of Washington produced during this period set
a precedent that generations of future artists would follow.  Architect
Thomas Jefferson brought a studied Neo-Classism to the new nation.  The
planning of Washington, D.C. and the Capitol building extended over
several decades. *

    Trumbull, the official painter of the new republic; both of these

     The equestrian portrait of Washington has a long history grounded
    in classical Roman imperial prototypes.  Efforts to identify the
    black soldier at far left edge of the battle scene, and
    interpretations of his position, have been important to a boom in
    scholarship on the participation of African Americans in the
    Revolution and all wars engaged by the U.S. military.
