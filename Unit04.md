**Unit 4: The Civil War Era to the Gilded Age** <span id="4"></span> 
*The visual culture of the Civil War is extensive, with the explosion of
the popular illustrated press.  For the first time, the death and
devastation of war was conveyed to those removed from the action through
photography. ** Naturalistic**, “realistic” styles become pervasive. 
The progress, hopes, and disintegration of the
**Reconstruction **platform for African Americans was documented by and
expressed through art.  During the same period, the Indian Wars were
brought to their devastating conclusion.  Impressionism came to American
late in the century, when nouveau riche industrialists began many of
America’s major art collections.   *

**4.1 The War Years** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*Note: Leaving behind the heroic military painting of the past, Winslow
Homer and other prominent artists of the era infused war scenes and
ancillary subjects with up-close, subtle solemnity.  They also provided
eyewitness sketches of the conflict for reproduction in illustrated
journals.  Commemorative prints included African American soldiers,
although public war memorials and commemorations of the Emancipation
Proclamation were fraught with racial politics. *

     Instructions: Click “Stories of War and Reconciliation, 1860-1877”;
    read the introduction.  Click on the first image, Eastman Johnson’s
    *Negro Life at the South *(1859).  Many scholars have written about
    the meanings and messages of this work.  It came to be known as “Old
    Kentucky Home,” even though it depicts black life in Washington,
    D.C. on the eve of the Civil War.  (Washington had a substantial
    population of free blacks by then, but slavery was not outlawed in
    the city until 1862).  Note the banjo player; among the many
    19<sup>th</sup>-century portrayals of black musicians, the banjo, an
    African-derived instrument, appears most frequently.  Many
    portrayals of black muscians during this time are overtly racist,
    others, sympathetic or ambiguous.  See brief examples at the

    the pictures in the Triptych. It appears a sympathetic view of
    African Americans in the Union Army, particularly runaways (from the
    South).  Stylistically, it may be considered “mainstream” for its
    time, with naturalistic flourishes.  It remains relatively tightly
    painted, with an overall staged sensibility.

    double-spaced pages in length.  Begin with data and a summary
    statement or two about the *thrust* of your comparison.  In other
    words, what is the comparison meant to elucidate about painting in
    the period?  (For example, similar or diverse views of a subject or
    issue, use of iconography, aspects of period style, etc.)  You might
    continue with an integrated comparison or move to prominent aspects
    of each, then conclude with direct comparison.

**4.2 The Late 19th Century** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Note: Impressionism originated in France in the 1870s and took some
time to cross the Atlantic, where it also generally remained closer to
earlier naturalistic Realism (as we have seen in later Homer works). 
Industrialism and mercantilism demanded new architectural forms.  In a
backlash to Reconstruction, graphic racial stereotypes facilitated the
on-set of **“Jim Crow”*** *segregation.*

    studies on racial tensions in post-Reconstruction American at the
    World’s Columbian Exhibition, where “Aunt Jemima,” a logo developed
    a few years earlier, was brought to life in a product exhibition. 
    (Her look and early incarnations were drawn from earlier “mammy”
    characters of black minstrelsy.)  Overtly or covertly racist
    graphics were common in period advertising, suggesting the growing
    appeal (in white society) of nostalgic **antebellum** sentiment that
    ushered in the “Jim Crow” order with the infamous “Plessy verses
    Ferguson” legal decision of 1896.  (This decision allowed states to
    implement segregation.)  Images are readily available in web
    searches, keyed to an active market in early “black collectibles.”
