**Unit 5: The New Century to the Great Depression** <span

*In the early 1900s, for the first time in American history, the wealthy
class in America rivaled the wealthy in Europe, and this development was
reflected in portraiture and collecting. However, America also saw
growing class division, facilitated by large waves of immigration. A new
underclass became subjects in art.  World War I brought United States
directly into world affairs and alliances.  The Harlem Renaissance takes
shape. *

**5.1 The Ashcan School and Early Abstraction** <span id="5.1"></span> 
*Note: Impressionism finally became popular in the early part of the
20<sup>th</sup> century, while “modern” urban American painters embraced
immigrant life as subject matter.  Photographs of the urban poor began
to affect public sentiment.  At the same time, the Armory Show brought
European abstraction to New York. *

**5.2 Harlem Renaissance** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Note: In 1925, philosopher Alain Locke published an interdisciplinary
anthology entitled “The New Negro” that initiated the loose movement,
which extended far beyond Harlem.  Overall, Locke advocated the embrace
of an African past in the development of new cultural forms.  Please
note that this loose movement emerged during WWI and that its formative
phase faded with the Depression.  However, the best known works by
associated artists date from the 1930s-40s. *
