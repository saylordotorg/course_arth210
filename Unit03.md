**Unit 3: 1800 to Circa 1860** <span id="3"></span> 
*Portrait painting became popular from the time of Protestant
infiltration of the colonies, in a shift from religious art of the
earlier Catholic regime.  The spread of photography in the 1840s in turn
diminished demand somewhat.  During this period, painter Charles Willson
Peale opened the first museum opened to the public in America.  Westward
expansion began in earnest and the nation’s population increases
dramatically.  Landscape painting gained stature as well.*

**3.1 Developments in Portraiture** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*Note: A demand for portraits encouraged many artists with varying
degrees of training to seize opportunities in this genre in the period
between 1800 and 1860.  American portraits of the 18<sup>th</sup> and
early 19<sup>th</sup> century tend toward a flattened style. 
Iconographic details relate to status, occupation, and important events
in the sitters’ lives.  *

    the field, as have the roots and boundaries of “folk art,” which has
    its own historical narrative that overlaps with the more canonical
    art historical one.  The webpage above is a good place to start

**3.2 Romantic Landscape** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Note: America represented divine wilderness to Europeans.  Painters
like Thomas Cole exploited literary and spiritual allusions to create
metaphoric visions of America’s natural wonders.  The “Luminists”
focused on pristine, dramatic light and overlapped with the “Hudson
River School.”  Landscapes of the West often included images of Native
Americans; some artists specialized in recording their enclaves and
customs in the wake of “Manifest Destiny.” *

**3.3 Painting Everyday Life** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*Note: American **genre **painting—depictions of ordinary life, as well
as still life “genre” (or “type”)—were visual commentaries on the
diversity of lifestyles emergent in the United States.  They could
appear “realistic” but were often composed to convey moral messages,
sometimes based on literary subjects.  “History” paintings were
influenced by genre subjects in terms of sentimentality and melodrama.*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: At the top of the page, click the first section,
    “Inventing American Stories 1765-1830.”  Read the introduction and
    view the 13 images/entries.  (Please note that images can be
    enlarged twice.)  Pay special attention to the following entries:   
     -\#3 and \#4: Review John Singleton Copley.  
     -\#10: John Lewis Krimmel, *The Quilting Frolic*, 1813.  Note the
    exaggerated coloration, ragged clothing, and marginal position of
    the black fiddler.  Black musicians would become a staple of the
    19<sup>th</sup>-century genre in which some artists specialized, and
    which have inspired diverse interpretations of artist intent and the
    appeal to the (white) market.  Disturbing depictions, which became
    stereotypes through repetition and by virtue of a lack of
    alternative, naturalistic images of real people of African descent
    were influenced by grotesque visages of “black-face” minstrelsy, a
    hugely popular entertainment in much of America into the
    20<sup>th</sup> century.  Note the young black serving girl, whose
    heavily laden serving tray is nearly her size.    
     -\#8 and \#11: Charles Willson Peale, *Exhumation of the* Mastadon,
    1805-08, and The *Artist in His Museum*, 1822.  In a new window,
    open related supplemental essay from The Academy of Natural Sciences
    in Philadelphia.  
        
     Return to the exhibition home/index page; click “Stories for the
    Public, 1830-1860,” and read the introduction and view the 28
    images/entries.  Listen to the audio commentaries provided for the
    following entries:  
     -\#19, George Caleb Bingham,*The County Election*, 1851-52.  
     -\#23, Lilly Martin Spencer, *Young Husband: First Marketing*, 1854
    and  
     - \#25, Spencer, *Kiss Me and You’ll Kiss the ‘Lasses*, 1856 (one
    6-minute audio on both works; \#25 is spoken about first)

     Instructions: Raphaelle Peale, a son of Charles Willson Peale
    (whose work you observed in "Inventing American Stories 1765-1830"),
    was the first acclaimed American still life painter.  The meticulous
    attention to surface and texture (derived from European, especially
    Dutch precedents) would be developed by the end of the century into
    amusing “**trompe l’oeil**” paintings that can almost appear to
    incorporate real objects (more in upcoming sections).

    (HTML and Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: Charles Peale experimented directly with “trickery”
    in this life-size work of two of his children on a staircase.  It
    includes a real wooden step coming into the gallery space at the
    bottom to enhance the illusionism.  Listen to the brief audio clips

     Instructions:  Read through this presentation in three steps: a
    close look at the painting, the career of Harnett, and the subject
    of money in still life painting; make comparisons with other
    artists.  While Harnett’s best work is late in the century, it is
    the epitome of what became associated with distinctly American
    19<sup>th</sup>-century trompe l’oeil.   The detail is hard to
    capture on screen; for larger images of works by Harnett, you may
    want to enlarge images from the collection of the [Metropolitan
    Museum of
    Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/). 
    Search “Harnett” (any search window) to retrieve enlarged images of
    his artwork.

**3.4 History Painting: Emanuel Leutze’s “George Washington Crossing the
Delaware” (1851)** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*Note: Perhaps the most widely recognized and reproduced American
painting in history, and the most frequently copied by other artists and
illustrations (whether in parody, homage, or both), Leutze’s “George
Washington Crossing the Delaware” is traditional for the period in terms
of composition, with the centered hero at its “peak.”  It does, however,
evoke a naturalistic sense of the setting and, while still detailed, the
brush strokes are somewhat looser than those in some of the precedents
we have seen; this is not as clear in reduced reproduction as it would
be in a first-hand viewing of the 25-foot-long canvas.  *

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “American Art Activity 1”**
    Instructions: Select an original work of American art (see
    INTRODUCTION, above) and compose an essay (2-3 typed, double-spaced
    pages) from notes taken at a personal viewing.  Refer to [The Saylor
    Foundation’s ARTH210
    Worksheet](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ARTH210-Worksheet.pdf). 
    Begin with data.  Include a careful description of the basic subject
    depicted, medium/technique, and formal aspects (as applicable/what
    is most prominent in the piece).  Then offer a summary of its
    potential meanings (iconographic analysis, context in terms of
    period, narrative, artist’s biography, etc., as applicable).  Draw
    on how scholars we have read so far have approached close viewings
    of individual works.
